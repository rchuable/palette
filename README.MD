# PALETTE EXTRACTOR
#### Video Demo:  <URL HERE>
#### Description:
Palette Extractor is a web-based application that extracts a palette--containing up to five dominant colors--from any image URL. This application is built with Flask and uses the Color Thief libraray. Hex codes accompany the palette for reference.

## Author's (or Artist's) Note
I built this app so that I could link reference images which had colors that I liked. The palette extractor helps me build gradient maps for digital art so it's easier to adjust the tones and hues of an illustration. I hope that this simple tool will help other artists and designers.
